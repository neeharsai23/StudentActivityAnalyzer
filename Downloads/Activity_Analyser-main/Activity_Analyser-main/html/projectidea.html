				<h1>Project Idea</h1>

                <p>The first step in building the app is to collect data about student activity. This can be done using mobile or smart watch app data or by having students manually input their activities into the app.

Once the data has been collected, it can be used to train machine learning models that can identify patterns and make predictions about future activities.

After the machine learning models have been trained, they can be integrated into this web app that allows students to track their activities and receive insights and recommendations based on their data.

In addition to the technical details of building the app, It can help students identify areas where they need to improve, make better decisions about their time management, and ultimately lead to better academic performance.
